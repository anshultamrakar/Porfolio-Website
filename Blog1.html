    <h1>How I transitioned from Mechanical Engineering into learning  Web Development</h1>
 
    <p>Unarguably Mechanical Engineering is one of the best fields of engineering to pursue. But the taste and passion can be different for people. But every decision you take in your life may not be right. Sometimes you may end up taking courses that may not bring the best in you.
        So if you are like me who finished mechanical engineering or any other degree or a field unrelated to Computer Science then this article is for you.
        So how did I make that shift? There is no magic pill, you need to be ready to commit at least 4hrs per day learning and doing projects. I started by working with a WordPress website. I created about 4 websites lol!!. And I didn’t commit much to build it and one of them was for a social community. That’s how I started as part-time work.
        Later, I wanted to learn how to create websites without WordPress or any other tools. We have youtube, twitter, Instagram, Netflix, Amazon etc. These kinds of websites require to be built from scratch by using more complex frameworks and libraries. That’s how I started to shift to web development.</p>
